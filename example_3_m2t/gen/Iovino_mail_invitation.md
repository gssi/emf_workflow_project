Dear Dr. Ludovico,
following the request of Adiel Tuyishime, approved by Scientific Director 
of the Computer Science Scientific Area, I am very pleased to invite you 
to the Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI), L'Aquila, Italy, 
in data 15:00 to run a scientific collaboration 
on the following topic:


**Theory and Practice in MDE**
Over the last years, several model repositories have been proposed
in response to the need of the MDE community for advanced systems supporting
the reuse of modeling artifacts. Modelers can interact with MDE repositories with
different intents ranging from merely repository browsing, to searching specific
artifacts satisfying precise requirements. The organization and browsing facilities
provided by current repositories is limited since they do not produce structured
overviews of the contained artifacts, and the categorization mechanisms (if any)
are based on manual activities. When dealing with large numbers of modeling
artifacts, such limitations increase the effort for managing and reusing artifacts
stored in model repositories. By focusing on metamodel repositories, in this paper we propose the application of clustering techniques to automatically organize
stored metamodels and to provide users with overviews of the application domains covered by the available metamodels. The approach has been implemented
in the MDEForge repository
