    <p align="justify"><small> <b>Abstract:
    </b> Over the last years, several model repositories have been proposed
         in response to the need of the MDE community for advanced systems supporting
         the reuse of modeling artifacts. Modelers can interact with MDE repositories with
         different intents ranging from merely repository browsing, to searching specific
         artifacts satisfying precise requirements. The organization and browsing facilities
         provided by current repositories is limited since they do not produce structured
         overviews of the contained artifacts, and the categorization mechanisms (if any)
         are based on manual activities. When dealing with large numbers of modeling
         artifacts, such limitations increase the effort for managing and reusing artifacts
         stored in model repositories. By focusing on metamodel repositories, in this paper we propose the application of clustering techniques to automatically organize
         stored metamodels and to provide users with overviews of the application domains covered by the available metamodels. The approach has been implemented
         in the MDEForge repository.</small></p>
